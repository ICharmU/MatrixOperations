### Note: Square matrices are mutated, so the original square matrix will not be retrievable after being passed as an argument

Create a MatrixOperations object for an m x n matrix, or a SquareMatrix object for an n x n matrix.   
Use the example matrices for how to create a square matrix. (the matrix is represented as a 2-D array)  
Create the desired object with the matrix (2-D array) passed in as an argument.   
To print the desired matrix use the printMatrix() method for a better visual understanding of the array.
